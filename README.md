# Deep learning from scratch

code is in python
dataset included(b_cancer.csv)

This deep learning code is written by combining knowledge from the coursera deep learning
specialization. It is coded primarily for the provided dataset. 
The dataset contains features and labels for classification(whether a specific breast cancer is benign or malign)
You can go ahead and change
the code in other to use other datasets.

Contains some deep learning algorithms such as gradient descent with momentum, rmsprop and adam
The code allows you to also use dropout and l2 regularization
